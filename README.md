# TukeySens

This package realizes the sensitivity analysis method based on Tukeyâ€™s
factorization, which allows flexible models for observed data and clean
separation of the identified and unidentified parts of the sensitivity
model. For theoretical details, [please see the full
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00399). Specifically, TukeySens
provides graphical tools that investigators can use to refine their
sensitivity analyses and visualize the results.

# How to install the package

To install the development version on GitHub make sure you have the
package `devtools` installed.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("JiajingZ/TukeySens")
```

# Basic Usage

``` r
# load package
library(TukeySens)
```

## Calibration

``` r
# Observed Pre-treatment Variables 
x = NHANES %>% select(-one_of("trt_dbp", "ave_dbp"))
# Treatment 
trt = NHANES %>% select(trt_dbp)
# Outcomes 
y = NHANES %>% select(ave_dbp)
# Sensitivity Parameter Sequence 
gamma = seq(0.01, 0.1, by = 0.001)
# plot 
caliplot(x, trt, y, gamma)
```

Based on the above plot, we may want to limit the magnitude of
sensitivity parameter \(\gamma_t\) with respect to body mass index
(bmi), one of the most important predictors in terms of partial variance
explained. Hence, we set \(|\gamma_t| \ \leq \ 0.05\) for the following
analysis.

## Model fitting

Fit the BART outcome model. `largest_gamma` is the absolute magnitude of
the largest sensitivity parameter for Y(0) and Y(1). `joint` is a
logical which determines whether we infer Y(0) and Y(1) models
independently or together.

``` r
# Observed data in treatment group
NHANES_trt <- NHANES %>% dplyr::filter(trt_dbp == 1)
x_trt <- NHANES_trt %>% select(-one_of("trt_dbp", "ave_dbp"))
y_trt <- NHANES_trt %>% select(ave_dbp)

# Observed data in control group 
NHANES_ctrl <- NHANES %>% dplyr::filter(trt_dbp == 0)
x_ctrl <- NHANES_ctrl %>% select(-one_of("trt_dbp", "ave_dbp"))
y_ctrl <- NHANES_ctrl %>% select(ave_dbp)

tukey_out <- fit_outcome(x_trt, y_trt, x_ctrl, y_ctrl, largest_gamma = 0.05, joint=FALSE)
```

## Visualizing the results

We can plot a heatmap of the resulting model fit using the standard plot
function with `type="ate"`. Alternatively, we can visualize ribbon plots
of the quantile treatment effects with `type="ate"`. Note that in the
current implementation QTE visualization can be slow for large datasets,
since we are computing quantiles of n-component normal mixtures.

### ATE by Heatmap

``` r


# ATE Heatmap 
# fit outcome separately


plot(tukey_out, type="ate")

plot(tukey_out, type="qte")
```

![](man/figures/heatmap_ate_separate.png)

``` r
# fit outcome jointly
heatmap_ate(x_trt, y_trt, x_ctrl, y_ctrl, largest_effect = 0.05, joint = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/heatmap_ate_joint.png)

## QTE by Ribbon Plot

``` r
# Ribbon Plot of QTE
gamma_select = rbind(c(0, 0), c(-0.03, 0.05), c(0.05, -0.02), c(-0.01, 0.01))
ribbon_qte(x_trt, y_trt, x_ctrl, y_ctrl, gamma_select)
```

![](man/figures/ribbon_qte_separate.png)

``` r
ribbon_qte(x_trt, y_trt, x_ctrl, y_ctrl, gamma_select, joint = TRUE)
```

In addition, the ATE can be visualized by contour plot and QTE can be
visualized by heatmap plot.
